This project was developed for the company I work at.

The project contains three parts:
1. Calendar for operators who work day after three;
2. Printing Register to monitor orders;
3. Printing Plan to schedule printing on 3D-printers.

# Calendar
The calendar was developed for operators who work day after three. It sets schedule automatically.
Operators have to do some tasks each day they work, tasks are also set automatically. When an operator does smth, he/she should note how many times the task was done during the day.
Some days are marked with color according to legend provided on the right bottom part of the page. Color means that the operator has to do some special task. Special tasks are also set automatically.
Also, when a mouse hovers a day inside calenda, the popup appears. It shows which tasks were done during the day and how many times.

If the day inside caledar is clicked, the server redirects a user to the page of the day. Operators can edit tasks here. Also, an extra task can be added for a day. Extra tasks are additional tasks, they can't be set automatically because they do now follow task templates.
